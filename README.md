# stilt_mapping
This repository contains code that is used to plot STILT footprint trajectory results. The original code is stored in _kai_scripts_archive as R scripts, which I modified to create plot_regional.R and plot_regional.py
in the main directory. 

The .R script was modified from the original to only include code relevant for plotting footprints. I also needed to change the SLURM script for my specific job parameters. 
The .py script was converted from the .R script, so that I could more easily analyze the results and customize the analysis code with a more familiar language.
